# Create a Scrabble::Scoring class which contains some sort of data structure to store the individual letter scores listed below - would that be under initializing of that class?

# general questions:
# Each Ruby class should be in its own file in lib/ - should we name the files after the classes? it wold intrupt requiring them all under the smae name... what shall we do?
